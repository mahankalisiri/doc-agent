### Readability
Score: Fair

Issues Found:
- Inconsistent heading levels (H6 followed by H1)
- Repetitive phrasing (e.g., 'Channel Name' and 'Channel Description' repeated)
- Lack of context in the introduction. Assumes prior knowledge of MoEngage.
- The 'Table of contents' section feels out of place and lacks detail.
Improvement Suggestions:
✅ Use a consistent heading hierarchy (e.g., H1, H2, H3).
✅ Rephrase sentences to avoid repetition.
✅ Provide a brief overview of MoEngage before diving into channels.
✅ Create a proper table of contents that links to different sections or remove it if unnecessary.


### Structure
Score: Fair

Issues Found:
- The document seems to be a collection of snippets rather than a cohesive guide.
- The 'Table of contents' section is strangely placed.
- The jump from H6 to H1 is jarring and disrupts the flow.
- The content abruptly ends.
Improvement Suggestions:
✅ Organize the document into logical sections with clear transitions.
✅ Place the table of contents at the beginning of the document.
✅ Ensure a smooth flow between different sections and heading levels.
✅ Provide a concluding section or a call to action.


### Completeness
Score: Poor

Issues Found:
- The document is incomplete and lacks detailed explanations of each channel.
- It only provides a brief description of each channel without going into specifics on how to use them.
- Missing information on setting up and configuring the channels.

- The list of contents at the beginning indicates a broader scope than what is actually present.
Improvement Suggestions:
✅ Provide a comprehensive description of each channel, including its features, benefits, and limitations.
✅ Include step-by-step instructions on how to set up and configure each channel.
✅ Add examples and use cases to illustrate how each channel can be used effectively.
✅ Expand on the concepts introduced, providing more in-depth information and practical guidance.


### Style Guidelines
Score: Fair

Issues Found:
- The tone is somewhat inconsistent.
- The language is not always precise.
- The formatting is inconsistent.
- Use of 'H6', 'H1', 'H4' should be replaced by the actual formatted headings.
Improvement Suggestions:
✅ Maintain a consistent and professional tone throughout the document.

✅ Ensure consistent formatting for headings, lists, and tables.
✅ Use active voice and direct language.
