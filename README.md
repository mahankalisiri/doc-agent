# Doc Agent - AI-Powered Documentation Improvement Agent

This project is a Streamlit web app that **scrapes any documentation URL**, analyzes the content for quality attributes like readability, structure, completeness, and style guidelines, and then generates a revised version with AI-powered suggestions.

It uses Selenium for scraping, your custom analysis functions, and a revision pipeline to improve documentation text.

---

## Features

* Dynamic URL input for scraping any documentation page
* Content extraction using Selenium (headless Chrome)
* AI-based document analysis (readability, structure, completeness, style)
* Generates improved documentation text based on analysis
* Download revised documentation as a text file
* Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit interface

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Google Chrome browser installed
* ChromeDriver installed and accessible in your PATH (must match your Chrome version)
* Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Sample `requirements.txt` might include:**

```
streamlit
selenium
langchain
pydantic


---

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/doc-agent.git
cd doc-agent
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and in your PATH:

* Download from: [https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/)
* Place it in a folder in your system PATH or specify its location explicitly in the code.

---

## Running the App

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser at the URL Streamlit provides (usually [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)).

Enter any public documentation URL, click **Analyze**, and wait for scraping and analysis.

You can then generate and download the revised documentation.

## Notes

* The scraper uses Selenium and ChromeDriver, so ensure browser compatibility.
* Some sites with strong bot protections or infinite scrolling may not scrape well.
* AI analysis and revision depends on your configured language model or API.
* This project is a base for documentation improvement — feel free to extend!
